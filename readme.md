This repository will contain all changes made to my Tronxy X5SA Pro.

The x5sa pro is a really cheap core-xy 3d printer which is really not that bad on its own. This printer can be improved by changing some parts that were included with the kit. Most parts are clones such as the print head and extruder. This was done to reduce the overall cost of the printer. I really like how they made their linear rails however it makes it more diffcult to use Voron or RatRig print heads without some design changes which most people cannot do on their own.

There are many things which need to be upraded in order to make this a better printer. I will list all changes I have made to my printer as well as all cad/stl files I made to improve printing.
