## Klipper Config

I use Klipper to control my 3d printer. It is a really nice interface which I have learned to love.
Initially I was using FLUIDD however the owner of that branch seems to have stepped away from the project
since there seemed to be some friction between MAINSAIL and FLUIDD interfaces. For this reason I have changed
to MAINSAIL. The config has not changed.
