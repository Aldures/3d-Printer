|1| btt octopus v1.1 | You need a board with no less than 5 drivers. You need atleast 2 drivers for Z-axis|
|1| tmc2209 drivers | I like the ability to use sensorless endstops. |
|1| 24v Power supply | The power supply shipped with the X5SA Pro is not really good. |

|1| bondtech bmg extruder | I like non cloned extruders, they function better |
|1| phaetus bms print head | any hot end can be used however I tried this one and was impressed |
|1| solid state switch for hotend heater ||
|1| bltouch v3.1 | I do not like intductive probes. This gives you the choice of using a glass top bed. |

|1| 8mm mic6 Aluminum 330mm x 330mm print bed | The stock print bed on the X5SA is really thing and mine was not really flat. |
|1| 310mm x 310mm magnetic print surface | I like flexible steel PEI print surfaces |
|1| 110v 750w 310mmx310mm silicone heat pad | Since I needed a new heater for print bed I decided to get something that heats fast.|
|1| solid state switch for heater||
|3| 450mm mgn12c linear rails | I am using the RATRIG trident configuration. It's overkill, but very sweet.|
